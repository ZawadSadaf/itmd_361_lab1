<h1>Zawad Sadaf</h1>
  <p>Hi everyone, My name is Zawad and I am a coterminal student majoring in Computer Science.</p>
  <p>My hometown is in Bangladesh, which is on the other side of the globe bordering India and Myammar. Although I grew up in Bangaldesh, at this point in my life I considered the US my home<p>
  <p>Outside of school, I am currently also part of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and I am interning part time at AbbVie. I recently joined EcoCar on their CAV team and I am excited to see what I can do for them.</p>
